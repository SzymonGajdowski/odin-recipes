        Pizza always makes a bad day feel better, and there is nothing nicer than a perfect slice of margherita pizza.
        Now you can make this recipe at home any time the craving strikes!
        Pizza margherita, as the Italians call it, is a simple pizza hailing from Naples. 
        When done right, margherita pizza features a bubbly crust, crushed San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. <strong>That is all.</strong>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 batch easy whole wheat pizza dough or 1 pound store-bought pizza dough</li>
            <li>1 large can (28 ounces) whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li>12 ounces (dry weight) ovoline-type mozzarella or other fresh mozzarella balls, ideally water-packed</li>
            <li>Handful of fresh basil, thinly sliced plus small leaves</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. If you’re using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the upper rack. Prepare dough through step 5.</li>
            <li>Place a medium mixing bowl in the sink and pour the canned tomatoes into the bowl, juices and all. Crush the tomatoes by hand. Spread about ¾ cup of the tomato sauce evenly over each pizza, leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges.</li>
            <li>If your mozzarella is packed in water, drain off the water and gently pat the mozzarella dry on a clean tea towel or paper towels. If you’re working with large mozzarella balls, tear them into smaller 1-inch balls. Distribute the mozzarella over the pizza, concentrating it a bit more in the center of the pizza, as it will melt toward the edges.</li>
            <li>Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is just turning golden, about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you’re using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it).</li>
            <li>Top each pizza generously with fresh basil, followed by a light back-and-forth drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkling of salt, and red pepper flakes, if you wish. Slice and enjoy. </li>
        
        </ol>
